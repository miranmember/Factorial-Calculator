# Factorial-Calculator
This Go program calculates the factorial of a given number. The number is input by the user at runtime. The program uses the big package to handle large numbers.
This Haskell project contains two programs that calculate the factorial of a given number. The number is input by the user at runtime.
## Usage
To run the go program, use the following command:
```
go run main.go
```
To run the Haskell Programs, use the followinc command:
```
ghc haskelAcc.hs
./haskelAcc
```
```
ghc haskelNat.hs
./haskelNat
```
You will then be prompted to enter a number. The program will output the factorial of the entered number.

## Example
Input:
```
ENTER THE NUMBER TO GET FACTORIAL: 5
```
Output:
```
120
```
